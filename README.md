# 42 AI Bootcamp Python Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises for the 42 AI Bootcamp in Python (https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python) I made in the 42 Paris coding school. 42 AI is the association for artificial intelligence in 42 Paris.   
The exercises are designed to teach Python programming concepts and skills, from basic syntax to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming and data analysis, here especially to apply to machine learning projects.

### Machine Learning

The second part of the bootcamp was about machine learning. Here I made the first day of exercises.
